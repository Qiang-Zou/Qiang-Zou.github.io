In DMAL, we are interested in questions like: Which parts are computerizable in design and manufacturing processes, especially for those form-related tasks? What are general computational principles underlying design and manufacturing? How can we apply the principles and build tools to automate the processes? These are the sort of stuff we are trying to understand in shaping what it means to **design by the computer and to manufacture in the computer**.

<!-- 如何进行跨媒体表达？如何实现大数据融合、匹配与协同计算？如何得出人工智能感知、推理、决策的高效模型？如何实现更具有感受、理解与交互能力的智能系统？ -->

In the short term, we are working on the following “form-process-property” problems:

1. Geometric modeling of designs

    1. Structure modeler (**H**ighly **C**omplex **S**tructures (HCS): large-scale, multi-resolution/material, and dynamic)

    2. Intelligent and direct CAD modeler (deep learning + complex surfaces, solids, and parametrics)

2. Geometric simulation of manufacturing processes

    1. Fast and high-precision simulation of freeform surface machining

    2. Optimal process planning for 3D printing

## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn` class.

## Notices

**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to a paragraph.
{: .notice}

## HTML Tags

### Address Tag

<address>
  1 Infinite Loop<br /> Cupertino, CA 95014<br /> United States
</address>

### Anchor Tag (aka. Link)

This is an example of a [link](http://github.com "Github").

### Abbreviation Tag

The abbreviation CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." ---<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

### Strike Tag

This tag will let you <strike>strikeout text</strike>.

### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>. -->
