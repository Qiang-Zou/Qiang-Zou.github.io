I am an Assistant Professor in the State Key Lab of CAD&CG at Zhejiang University. I got my Ph.D. from UBC in 2019, working with Dr. Hsi-Yung Feng. My research interests are computational principles behind engineering design processes and manufacturing operations, as well as their algorithmic implementations. Current research work includes design modeling and manufacturing simulation with emphasis on: (1) seamless integration of direct modeling and parametric modeling in CAD; and (2) path optimization for CNC machining and 3D printing in CAM.

**Pinned**: Highly motivated students (undergrad intern, Masterâ€™s and Ph.D.) are welcome to join our group to develop next-generation software for design and manufacturing. A solid background in Mechanical Engineering and Programming is a plus. Please shoot me an email if you are interested.
