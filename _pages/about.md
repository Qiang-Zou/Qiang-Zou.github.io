Assistant Professor in the State Key Lab of CAD&CG at ZJU, Ph.D. in CAD/CAM (UBC 19', with Dr. Hsi-Yung Feng). My research and engineering experience revolves around geometry, engineering, and optimization to develop simpler algorithms for design and manufacturing. I am currently working on direct & parametric modeling in CAD, and tool path planning for CNC machining and 3D printing in CAM.

I am looking for highly motivated graduate students (Masterâ€™s and Ph.D.) to join our group to develop next-generation software for engineering design and manufacturing (CNC machining & 3D printing). A solid background in Mechanical Engeering and Programming is a plus. Please shoot me an email if you are interested.
