I am currently an Assistant Professor at the State Key Lab of CAD&CG and the College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University (ZJU), after getting my Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia (UBC). My research interests lie in identifying computational principles behind design and manufacturing processes, as well as their algorithmic implementations, to drive the paradigm shift from computer-**aided** design & manufacturing towards computer-**automated** design & manufacturing (defined as: design by the computer & manufacturing in the computer).

Current research work includes design modeling and manufacturing simulation with emphasis on (1) the basic research of geometric and physical modeling of surfaces, solids and structures, and (2) the applied research of intelligent and intuitive CAD modeling, and virtual machining and 3D printing.

**Pinned**: Highly motivated students (both undergrads and grads) are welcome to join our group to develop next-generation software for design and manufacturing. A solid background in Mechanical Engineering and Programming is a plus. Please shoot me an email if you are interested in working with me.
