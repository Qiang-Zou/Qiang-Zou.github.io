I am an Assistant Professor in the State Key Lab of CAD&CG at Zhejiang University. I got my Ph.D. from UBC in 2019, working with Dr. Hsi-Yung Feng. My research work revolves around geomeric problems in design and manufacturing, with particular interests in design modeling and manufacturing simulation: (1) Direct & parametric modeling in CAD; and (2) tool path planning for CNC machining and 3D printing in CAM.

Highly motivated graduate students (Masterâ€™s and Ph.D.) are welcome to join our group to develop next-generation software for design and manufacturing. A solid background in Mechanical Engeering and Programming is a plus. Please shoot me an email if you are interested.
