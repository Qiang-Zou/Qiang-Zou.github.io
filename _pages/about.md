I am an Assistant Professor in the State Key Lab of CAD&CG at Zhejiang University. I got my Ph.D. from UBC in 2019, working with Dr. Hsi-Yung Feng. I am interested in computational principles behind engineering design and manufacturing, as well as their algorithmic implementations. My current research work revolves around design modeling and manufacturing simulation, with emphasis on: (1) direct modeling and parametric modeling in CAD; and (2) CNC machining and 3D printing path optimization in CAM.

Highly motivated graduate students (Masterâ€™s and Ph.D.) are welcome to join our group to develop next-generation software for design and manufacturing. A solid background in Mechanical Engeering and Programming is a plus. Please shoot me an email if you are interested.
