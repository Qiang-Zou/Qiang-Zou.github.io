I am an Assistant Professor in the State Key Lab of CAD&CG at Zhejiang University. I got my Ph.D. from UBC in 2019, working with Dr. Hsi-Yung Feng. My research interests lie in computational principles behind engineering design processes and manufacturing operations, as well as their algorithmic implementations. Current research work includes design modeling and manufacturing simulation with emphasis on:\
(1) Direct & parametric modeling in CAD
(2) CNC machining and 3D printing path optimization in CAM

Highly motivated graduate students (Masterâ€™s and Ph.D.) are welcome to join our group to develop next-generation software for design and manufacturing. A solid background in Mechanical Engineering and Programming is a plus. Please shoot me an email if you are interested.
