I am currently an Assistant Professor at the College of Computer Science and the State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University (ZJU). I got my Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia (UBC). My research interests are computational principles behind design processes and manufacturing operations, as well as their algorithmic implementations. Current research work includes design modeling and manufacturing simulation with emphasis on: (1) Parametric/Direct integration in CAD modeling; (2) CAD modeler for 3D printing; and (3) Geometric simulation+optimization for CNC machining & 3D printing.

**Pinned**: Highly motivated students (both undergrads and grads) are welcome to join our group to develop next-generation software for design and manufacturing. A solid background in Mechanical Engineering and Programming is a plus. Please shoot me an email if you are interested in working with me.
