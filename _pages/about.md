I am an Assistant Professor in the State Key Lab of CAD&CG at Zhejiang University. I got my Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia in 2019. My research interests are computational principles behind engineering design processes and manufacturing operations, as well as their algorithmic implementations. Current research work includes design modeling and manufacturing simulation with emphasis on: (1) seamless integration of direct modeling and parametric modeling in CAD; and (2) path optimization and process simulation for CNC machining and 3D printing in CAM.

**Pinned**: Highly motivated students (both undergrads and grads) are welcome to join our group to develop next-generation software for design and manufacturing. A solid background in Mechanical Engineering and Programming is a plus. Please shoot me an email if you are interested.
